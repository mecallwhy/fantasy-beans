Fantasy Beans is browser-based fantasy football game. User assemble virtual imaginary team composed of real-life football players from Serie A (Italian foodball league). Every real-life player scores points based on his/her real-life perfomances on the pitch. Every goal, accurate pass, or tackle counts and gives points to every user that "bought" certain player to his squad (using "Kredits" - in-game imaginary currency). 
User can sell and buy players from Market after every Matchday (usually 1 Matchday = 1 weekend). Prices of players change during season based on players performance.
Users then compete with each other in leagues or head-to-head duels.
